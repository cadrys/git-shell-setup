# git-setup
A discombobulated potpourri of disparate stuff that's so b0rked and in flux that no readme is attempted.

In a nutshell, peel it like an onion.

#### Stuff:

* .gitconfig
* .bashrc/.bash_profile scripts
* bin/ dir scripts
* git hooks
* git prompt script
* winmerge script
* git template dir
* scite scripts
